            Last year I lost my job due to covid. While in lockdown, a friend gifted me a programming game.</p>
          <p>And it was love at first line.</p>
          <p>
            Now I&#39;m addicted to learning and passionate about coding, aiming for the balance between readability
            and performance. Outside of the skills I listed below I&#39;m learning Java to expose myself in a different
            coding paradigm, become familiar with OOP, SOLID Principles and Design Patterns, and eventually learn Spring/Spring Boot.
          </p>
          <p>
            My main focus is to become part of a team of like-minded developers, grow my skillset, build good software and solve challenging problems.
